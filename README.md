### PyTimer

The other day my girlfriend asked me to set a timer for a batch of cookies going in the oven. I was writing some random code at the time and thought, wouldn't it be great if i could just do this from the command line?

One burnt, forgotten tray of cookies later Pytimer was complete...

This is a super simple command line based timer with two functions, a countown clock and a timer.

Run it and hit enter to provide an amount of time to countdown - or type something before hitting enter to countdown to a specific clock time.

Provide inputs in 24 hour format HH:MM:SS, such as `12:34:57`

This will display a countdown clock as so:

      ,    ___       ___     ,       ___   ___
     /|       |         |   /|      |     |
      |    ___|  .   ___|  / |   .  |___  |___
      |   |      .      | /__|_  .      | |   |
    __|__ |___       ___|    |       ___| |___|
